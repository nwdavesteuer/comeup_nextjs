# Fix React 19 Compatibility Issue

## The Problem
`@react-three/fiber@8.18.0` doesn't fully support React 19, causing the error:
```
undefined is not an object (evaluating 'ReactSharedInternals.ReactCurrentOwner')
```

## The Solution

I've updated `package.json` to use the alpha version of `@react-three/fiber` which supports React 19.

### Step 1: Install the Updated Version

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/jonahsteuer/Documents/GitHub/comeup_nextjs
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This will install `@react-three/fiber@alpha` which is compatible with React 19.

### Step 2: Restart Dev Server

After installation, restart your dev server:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test

Refresh your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The error should be gone!

## Why This Works

The alpha version of `@react-three/fiber` includes fixes for React 19's internal changes. React 19 changed how it exposes `ReactSharedInternals`, and the alpha version handles this correctly.

## Note

The alpha version is stable enough for development, but keep an eye out for the stable release. Once `@react-three/fiber` releases a stable version with React 19 support, you can update to that.
