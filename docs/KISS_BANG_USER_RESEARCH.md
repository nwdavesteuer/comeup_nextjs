## Key Insights

### Pain Points
1. **Consistency is the #1 struggle** - Can't post consistently
2. **Content isn't reaching fans** - Snapshots aren't driving streams or building fanbase
3. **Coordination is a chore** - Time, ideas, and coordination make it hard
4. **No performance insights** - Don't know what's working or why
5. **Unclear direction for videographer** - Ruby needs better planning tools

### Current Workflow
- **Shoot Schedule:** 1 day/week with videographer (Ruby) and bandmate (Kaya)
- **Content Creation:** One 30-second video cut into 3 different 15-20 second snapshots
- **Posting:** Ad-hoc, immediate posting (no scheduling)
- **Planning:** No planning before release, only after
- **Coordination:** Text messages, Google Drive for edits
- **Visual References:** Pinterest boards shared via text

### Success Metrics (Priority Order)
1. **Streams** - Most important
2. **Views** - Second priority
3. **Likes & Comments** - Third priority
4. **Fan Engagement** - Building superfans (streams repeatedly, shares content, comes to shows, buys merch, DMs)

### Videographer (Ruby) Needs
- **Treatment 1 week before shoot** - Visual references, shot descriptions, mood, color palette
- **Clear direction** - No unclear briefs or last-minute changes
- **Shot list assistance** - Help creating shot lists based on universe/galaxy/world
- **Edit review workflow** - Upload edits, get feedback, version control

### Bandmate (Kaya) Needs
- **See treatments and schedules** - Needs access to platform
- **Availability coordination** - Scheduling shoot days

## Platform Differentiation

**vs. ChatGPT:** We understand music promotion, release cycles, and fan building
**vs. Buffer/Later:** We help CREATE content, not just schedule it
**vs. Agencies:** Self-service with AI assistance, affordable, scalable
**vs. Generic Content Tools:** Music-specific, fan-building focused, performance insights

**The white space:** Nobody combines visual universe building + content creation + performance insights + fan discovery + team coordination for music artists.
