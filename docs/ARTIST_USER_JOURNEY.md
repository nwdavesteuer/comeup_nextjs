**User Type:** Artist (Prospective/New User)

---

## Journey Overview

**Context:** Artist thinking about joining The Multiverse  
**Entry Point:** Homepage - Interactive 3D view of all artists' universes  
**Goal:** Explore existing universes, then create own universe

---

## SCENE 1: FIRST IMPRESSION - THE MULTIVERSE VIEW (30 seconds - 2 minutes)

### Initial Experience

**What the artist sees:**
- Interactive three-dimensional Google Earth-esque view
- All artists' universes visible in the Multiverse
- Can explore, look, and click on different artists' universes
- **View-only mode** - cannot see unreleased content

### Key Interactions

1. **Exploration:**
   - Pan around the 3D space
   - Zoom in/out on different universes
   - Click on universes to explore deeper

2. **Privacy Controls:**
   - Cannot see specific information about galaxies/worlds that haven't been released
   - Only public galaxies/worlds are viewable
   - Can see everything artists have made public

**User Thought:** "This is incredible - I can see how other artists are building their visual universes. This gives me inspiration for my own."

## SCENE 2: EXPLORING "THE JULIAN KENJIVERSE" (2-5 minutes)

### Zooming Into a Universe

**Action:** Artist clicks on "The Julian Kenjiverse"

**What happens:**
- 3D map zooms in
- Reveals 3 equidistant galaxies

### Galaxy 1: "Rabbit Season"

**Visual Details:**
- 6 worlds orbiting around a bright yellow sun
- Each world is a slightly different shade:
  - Dark purple
  - Bright yellow
  - Light grey
  - Deep blue
  - Hot pink
  - White
- Two planets each have a moon orbiting around them

**User Thought:** "The color differences must represent different visual identities for each song. The moons are interesting - maybe those are bonus tracks or remixes?"

### Galaxy 2: "Seasons"

**Visual Details:**
- Only 1 light blue planet
- Simpler, more minimal galaxy

**User Thought:** "This seems like a smaller project - maybe a single or EP?"

### Galaxy 3: "Strobe Light Psychosis"

**Visual Details:**
- 7 planets total
- Dark green planet closest to the sun (actively orbiting)
- Other 6 planets are greyed out and not in motion

**User Thought:** "The greyed out ones must be unreleased. The dark green one is probably the next release."

---

## SCENE 3: DEEP DIVE INTO "STROBE LIGHT PSYCHOSIS" GALAXY (1-2 minutes)

### Clicking Into the Galaxy

**Action:** Artist clicks into "Strobe Light Psychosis" galaxy

**What happens:**
- Interface zooms in
- Galaxy now takes up nearly the entire UI
- Title "Strobe Light Psychosis" visible
- Countdown timer appears next to title
- Timer indicates: music has not yet been released to streaming platforms

### The Active World: "Melody"

**Visual Details:**
- Dark green planet titled "Melody"
- Planet is actively orbiting around the sun

**Interaction - Hover:**
- Artist hovers over "Melody"
- Upbeat EDM song with distorted drums starts playing
- Music preview plays automatically on hover

**User Thought:** "So hovering plays a preview! This is a great way to discover music."

### The Greyed Out Worlds

**Action:** Artist tries clicking on greyed out planets

**What happens:**
- Info bubble pops up
- Message: "this world is currently being built. It will be viewable to the public in 33 days."

**User Thought:** "So there's a privacy/development mode. Artists can work on worlds before making them public. That makes sense - you want to build it out before sharing."

---

## SCENE 4: EXPLORING "RABBIT SEASON" GALAXY (2-3 minutes)

### Zooming Into Another Galaxy

**Action:** Artist zooms out of "Strobe Light Psychosis" and clicks on "Rabbit Season"

**What happens:**
- Galaxy takes up the entire screen
- 6 worlds visible, each with title above as they orbit
- Dark purple world "Cliche" is closest to the sun

### Hover Interaction

**Action:** Artist hovers over "Cliche"

**What happens:**
- Mid tempo indie pop tune with dreamy vocals starts playing
- Music preview continues playing

**User Thought:** "I love this - I can preview the music just by hovering. The visual and audio are connected."

---

## SCENE 5: DEEP DIVE INTO "CLICHE" WORLD (3-5 minutes)

### Clicking Into a World

**Action:** Artist clicks onto "Cliche" world

**What happens:**
- UI zooms in dramatically
- Dark purple world "Cliche" now takes up majority of UI
- World is in its own circular motion (spinning on axis, like Earth)
- Mid tempo tune continues playing in background

### The Snapshots - Visual Memories

**What the artist sees:**
- 6 rectangular videos surrounding the world
- Each video has a strong vignette around it
- They appear like "memories" or "events" that occurred on this planet
- Videos are positioned in empty space around the spinning world

### Snapshot 1: Forest Lip Sync

**Location:** Top left of the "Cliche" world

**Content:**
- 15 second loop
- Julian Kenji (artist) running through lush forest
- Lip syncing lyrics to "Cliche"

**Visual Style:** Strong vignette, cinematic quality

### Snapshot 2: Snowy Forest Scene

**Location:** Right side of the planet

**Content:**
- 10 second loop
- Julian Kenji from far away in barren snowy forest
- Appears scared, almost running from something

**Visual Style:** Strong vignette, atmospheric, moody

**User Thought:** "These snapshots are like visual memories of the song. They're not just social media posts - they're part of the world's visual story. The vignettes make them feel like memories or events."

### Understanding the Connection

**Key Realization:**
- Snapshots are not just content - they're visual representations of the world
- They tell a story about the song
- They're positioned around the world like memories orbiting it
- The world itself spins, creating a living, dynamic experience

**User Thought:** "This is so much more than a content calendar. This is building a visual universe where each song has its own world, and the snapshots are memories from that world. I want to create this for my music."

## SCENE 6: RETURNING TO THE MULTIVERSE VIEW (30 seconds)

### Zooming Out

**Action:** Artist zooms out of "Cliche" world, out of "Rabbit Season" galaxy, and out of "The Julian Kenjiverse"

**What happens:**
- Returns to the same screen seen when first opening the app
- Back to the Multiverse view with all artists' universes

**User Thought:** "I've seen enough. I understand how this works. I want to create my own universe."

---

## SCENE 7: DISCOVERING THE CREATE OPTION (10 seconds)

### Finding the Creation Entry Point

**Action:** Artist hovers over a black, empty space in the Multiverse

**What happens:**
- "+" symbol appears
- Title text: "create my own universe"

**User Thought:** "Perfect! There's a clear way to get started. The empty space represents where my universe could be."

### Initiating Creation

**Action:** Artist clicks on the "+" symbol

**What happens:**
- New window appears
- (Journey continues - awaiting next description)

**User Thought:** "Time to build my own visual universe. I'm excited to see what the creation process looks like."

## Key Insights from This Journey

### Visual Design Principles

1. **3D Spatial Navigation:**
   - Google Earth-style interface enables exploration
   - Zoom levels: Multiverse → Universe → Galaxy → World
   - Spatial relationships matter (distance from sun = release timeline)

2. **Color as Identity:**
   - Each world has a unique color representing its visual identity
   - Colors differentiate worlds within a galaxy
   - Visual cohesion through color palette

3. **Motion and Life:**
   - Worlds orbit around suns
   - Worlds spin on their axis when viewed closely
   - Greyed out worlds are static (not yet released)
   - Active worlds are in motion

4. **Audio Integration:**
   - Hover to preview music
   - Audio continues playing when exploring a world
   - Music and visuals are deeply connected

### Privacy and Release Controls

1. **Public vs. Private:**
   - Artists control what's public
   - Unreleased worlds are greyed out
   - Info bubbles explain why content isn't viewable
   - Countdown timers for upcoming releases

2. **Development Mode:**
   - Worlds can be "being built" before public release
   - Specific release dates can be set
   - Artists work in private, release when ready

### Snapshot Concept Evolution

1. **Snapshots as Memories:**
   - Not just social media posts
   - Visual memories/events from the world
   - Positioned around the world like orbiting memories
   - Strong vignettes create cinematic quality

2. **Video-First:**
   - Snapshots are rectangular videos
   - Looping content (10-15 seconds)
   - Visual storytelling, not just captions

3. **Spatial Relationship:**
   - Snapshots exist in space around the world
   - They're part of the world's visual landscape
   - They tell the story of the world

### User Experience Flow

1. **Discovery First:**
   - Homepage is exploration, not signup
   - Artists see value before committing
   - Inspiration from existing universes

2. **Progressive Disclosure:**
   - Start broad (Multiverse)
   - Zoom into details (Universe → Galaxy → World)
   - Each level reveals more information

3. **Clear Call-to-Action:**
