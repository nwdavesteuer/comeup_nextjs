# Three.js Integration - The Multiverse

**Status:** ✅ Integrated  
**Date:** January 8, 2026

---

## Packages Installed

Added to `package.json`:
- `three` - Core Three.js library
- `@react-three/fiber` - React renderer for Three.js
- `@react-three/drei` - Useful helpers and components
- `@types/three` - TypeScript types

**To install, run:**
```bash
npm install
```

---

## 3D Components Created

### 1. **Multiverse3D.tsx**
- 3D view of all artists' universes
- Each universe appears as a sphere
- Click to explore universes
- Google Earth-style navigation (pan, zoom, rotate)

### 2. **Universe3D.tsx**
- 3D view of galaxies within a universe
- Galaxies positioned equidistantly
- Click to explore galaxies
- Navigation controls

### 3. **Galaxy3D.tsx**
- 3D view of worlds within a galaxy
- Sun in center (glowing, rotating)
- Worlds orbit around sun
- Worlds spin on their axis
- Distance from sun = release timeline
- Greyed out worlds for unreleased content
- Click worlds to build/edit

### 4. **EmptyUniverseView.tsx** (Updated)
- Now uses 3D canvas
- Plus symbol in 3D space for creating galaxy
- Stars background
- Navigation controls

### 5. **GalaxyView.tsx** (Updated)
- Now uses `Galaxy3D` component
- 3D visualization of galaxy with orbiting worlds

---

## Features Implemented

### Navigation
- ✅ Pan (drag to move)
- ✅ Zoom (scroll or pinch)
- ✅ Rotate (drag with right-click or two-finger drag)
- ✅ Smooth camera controls via OrbitControls

### Visual Effects
- ✅ Stars background (using drei Stars component)
- ✅ Glowing sun with point light
- ✅ Emissive materials for glowing effects
- ✅ Hover effects (scale up on hover)
- ✅ Color-coded worlds
- ✅ Greyed out worlds (transparent, no glow)

### Interactions
- ✅ Click worlds to open creation form
- ✅ Hover to highlight
- ✅ Smooth animations (orbiting, spinning)

---

## Technical Details

### Camera Setup
- Default position: `[0, 8, 15]` for galaxy view
- FOV: 75 degrees
- Antialiasing enabled

### Lighting
- Ambient light: 0.4-0.6 intensity
- Point lights for sun and general illumination
- Emissive materials for self-illumination

### Performance
- Uses React Suspense for lazy loading
- Optimized geometry (32 segments for spheres)
- Efficient re-renders with useFrame hooks

---

## Next Steps

### Enhancements Needed
1. **Text Rendering**: Currently using drei Text component, but may need custom fonts
2. **Audio Preview**: Add hover-to-play music functionality
3. **Snapshot Display**: Show snapshots as 3D elements around worlds
4. **Moons**: Add moon orbits around worlds
5. **Better Materials**: Add textures, normal maps for more realism

### Optimization
- Consider LOD (Level of Detail) for many universes
- Implement frustum culling
- Add performance monitoring

---

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { Galaxy3D } from '@/components/multiverse/Galaxy3D';

<Galaxy3D
  galaxy={myGalaxy}
  onWorldClick={(world) => {
    console.log('Clicked world:', world);
  }}
/>
```

---

## Known Issues

1. **Text Rendering**: drei Text component may need custom font files
2. **Performance**: May need optimization for many worlds
3. **Mobile**: Touch controls may need adjustment

**Three.js is now fully integrated!** 🎉
