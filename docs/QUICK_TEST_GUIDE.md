---

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /Users/jonahsteuer/Documents/GitHub/comeup_nextjs
npm install
```

This will install all packages including the new Three.js dependencies.

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
touch .env.local
```

Add your Claude API key (required for snapshot generation):

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Note:** You can test without the API key, but snapshot generation won't work.

### Step 3: Start the Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
▲ Next.js 15.x.x
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
✓ Ready in X seconds
```

### Step 4: Open in Browser

Navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **Start Simple:** Create 1 galaxy with 1 world first
2. **Test Navigation:** Spend time exploring the 3D space
3. **Try Different Colors:** See how worlds look with different colors
4. **Test Snapshot Generation:** Make sure AI is generating good descriptions
5. **Check Mobile:** Test on mobile device if possible (may need adjustments)

---

## 🚨 Known Issues

- **No Data Persistence:** Refresh loses all data (expected - no database yet)
- **Mock Pinterest Images:** Using Unsplash placeholders (expected)
- **Text Rendering:** Some 3D text may not render perfectly (drei Text component)
- **Performance:** May be slow with many worlds (optimization needed)
