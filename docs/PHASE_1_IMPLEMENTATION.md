- ✅ API route structure (`/api/calendar/sync`)
- ✅ Event creation from snapshots and shoot days
- ✅ Google Calendar API formatting utilities

**Current Status:**
- ⚠️ **Mock Implementation** - OAuth and actual Google Calendar API integration pending
- Structure is in place for easy OAuth integration
- Events are formatted correctly for Google Calendar API

**Key Functions:**
- `createSnapshotEvents()` - Converts snapshots to calendar events
- `createShootDayEvents()` - Converts shoot days to calendar events

- ✅ Customizable reminder timing (days before, time of day)
- ✅ Reminder type selection (posts, shoots, edit deadlines)

**Current Status:**
- ✅ **UI Complete** - Backend notification system pending
- Settings can be saved (needs backend integration)
- Structure ready for notification service integration

**Files Created:**
- `components/multiverse/ReminderSettings.tsx`

**Files Updated:**

### 6. Enhanced World Creation Form

**What was built:**
- ✅ Integrated all Phase 1 features into `WorldCreationForm`
- ✅ Tab navigation: Snapshots, Timeline, Shoot Days, Calendar Sync
- ✅ Seamless workflow from snapshot generation to calendar sync
- ✅ Confirmed shoot days tracking

**User Flow:**
1. Create world → Generate snapshots
2. View snapshots in list format
3. View timeline visualization
4. Review and confirm shoot days
5. Sync to Google Calendar

**Files Updated:**
- `components/multiverse/WorldCreationForm.tsx`

## 📊 Data Flow

```
World Creation
    ↓
Generate Snapshots (AI)
    ↓
Calculate Posting Dates (2 weeks before → 8 weeks after)
    ↓
Calculate Filming Dates (1 week before posting)
    ↓
Group by Filming Date → Shoot Days
    ↓
Create Calendar Events
    ↓
Sync to Google Calendar (when connected)
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Date Calculation Logic

**Posting Schedule:**
- Total timeline: 14 days before + Release day + 56 days after = 71 days
- Snapshots distributed proportionally across timeline
- Optimal posting days: Tuesday, Thursday, Friday (auto-adjusted)
- Platform-specific posting times (Instagram: 2pm, TikTok: 6pm, Twitter: 12pm)

**Filming Schedule:**
- Filming date = Posting date - 7 days
- Snapshots with same filming date grouped into single shoot day

### Week Labels

- `Week -2`, `Week -1` - Before release
- `Release Day` - Release date
- `Week +1`, `Week +2`, etc. - After release

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Generating Snapshots with Posting Dates

```typescript
// API automatically calculates posting dates
const response = await fetch('/api/generate-snapshots', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    worldName: 'Will I Find You',
    releaseDate: '2024-06-08',
    color: '#FFD700',
    visualReferences: [...],
  }),
});

// Response includes snapshots with postingDate and weekLabel
const strategy = await response.json();
// strategy.snapshots[0].postingDate = "2024-05-25"
// strategy.snapshots[0].weekLabel = "Week -2"
```

### Calculating Shoot Days

```typescript
import { calculateShootDays } from '@/lib/shoot-day-calculator';

const shootDays = calculateShootDays(snapshots, worldId);
// Groups snapshots by filming date
// Returns ShootDay[] with suggested dates
```

### Syncing to Calendar

```typescript
import { createSnapshotEvents, syncToGoogleCalendar } from '@/lib/google-calendar';

const events = createSnapshotEvents(snapshots, worldName);
const result = await syncToGoogleCalendar(events);
// Returns { success: true, syncedCount: 10 }
```
