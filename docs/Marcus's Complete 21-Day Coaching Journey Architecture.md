## **WEEK 1: Foundation & Discovery (Days 1-7)**

### **Phase 1.1: Assessment & Reframing (Days 1-2)**

**Thread:** Initial discovery and mindset shift  
**Mode:** Coach (90%) / Assistant (10%)  
**Objective:** Understand situation, identify real barriers, shift perspective

#### **Script 1: Initial Assessment \[Day 1\]**

**HANK:** "Hi, I'm Hank. I'll help you navigate your career transition. What's bringing you here today?"

**MARCUS:** "I'm transitioning out of the military. Got my degree but need work ASAP. Single dad, bills aren't waiting."

**HANK:** "Thank you for your service. Single parent with urgent needs \- that takes courage to manage. When you say ASAP, what's your actual timeline?"

**MARCUS:** "Terminal leave ends next month. Maybe 6-8 weeks of savings."

**HANK:** "Six weeks is workable with the right approach. Tell me \- what's been your biggest frustration so far in this transition?"

**MARCUS:** "I've sent out maybe 50 applications. Two callbacks, both went nowhere. They ask about 'corporate experience' and I can see them check out when I say military."

**HANK:** "That disconnect is real. What do you think they're not understanding about your military experience?"

**MARCUS:** "I don't know... I managed logistics for 800 people, led teams, handled millions in equipment. But it's like they don't see how that translates."

**HANK:** "You just listed massive operational responsibilities. What would happen if a civilian company had someone managing logistics for 800 people?"

**MARCUS:** "They'd probably call them... a director? Operations manager?"

**HANK:** "Exactly. You've been doing executive-level work. The challenge isn't your experience \- it's the translation. What credentials did you pick up to help bridge that gap?"

**MARCUS:** "Just got my PMP certification. Thought that would help."

**HANK:** "PMP was strategic \- it validates your project management in civilian terms. But here's what most veterans miss \- beyond translation, you need validation from peers who've made this journey. Ready to try a different approach?"

---

### **Phase 1.2: Skills Translation Workshop (Days 3-4)**

**Thread:** Military-to-civilian translation  
**Mode:** Coach (70%) / Assistant (30%)  
**Objective:** Create comprehensive translation guide

#### **Script 2: Translation Deep Dive \[Day 3\]**

**HANK:** "Let's translate your military experience into language employers instantly understand. When you say you led 25 people, what were you actually doing hour by hour?"

**MARCUS:** "Morning briefs, resource allocation, dealing with problems, making sure operations ran smooth under pressure, reporting up the chain."

**HANK:** "You just described what a civilian operations manager does daily. Your $2M equipment responsibility \- in corporate terms, that's what?"

**MARCUS:** "Budget management? P\&L responsibility?"

**HANK:** "Exactly. Now I'll help you build your translation toolkit. Tell me about a time when everything went wrong and you had to fix it."

**MARCUS:** "During a deployment, our supply chain got disrupted. Had to coordinate with multiple vendors across

# **Revised Marcus Journey Script \- With Socratic Coaching Approach**

## **SCENE 1: ENTRY & ASSESSMENT (2 minutes)**

**HANK:** "Hi, I'm Hank. I'll help you navigate your career transition. What's bringing you here today?"

**MARCUS:** "I'm transitioning out of the military. Got my degree but need work ASAP. Single dad, bills aren't waiting."

**HANK:** "Thank you for your service. Single parent with urgent needs \- that takes courage to manage. When you say ASAP, what's your actual timeline?"

**MARCUS:** "Terminal leave ends next month. Maybe 6-8 weeks of savings."

**HANK:** "Six weeks is workable with the right approach. Tell me \- what's been your biggest frustration so far in this transition?"

**MARCUS:** "I've sent out maybe 50 applications. Two callbacks, both went nowhere. They ask about 'corporate experience' and I can see them check out when I say military."

**HANK:** "That disconnect is real. What do you think they're not understanding about your military experience?"

**MARCUS:** "I don't know... I managed logistics for 800 people, led teams, handled millions in equipment. But it's like they don't see how that translates."

**HANK:** "You just listed massive operational responsibilities. What would happen if a civilian company had someone managing logistics for 800 people?"

**MARCUS:** "They'd probably call them... a director? Operations manager?"

**HANK:** "Exactly. You've been doing executive-level work. The challenge isn't your experience \- it's the translation. What credentials did you pick up to help bridge that gap?"

**MARCUS:** "Just got my PMP certification. Thought that would help."

**HANK:** "PMP was strategic \- it validates your project management in civilian terms. E-6 logistics plus PMP typically opens doors to operations management at $75-95K. But here's what most veterans miss \- beyond translation, you need validation. Who do you know who's successfully made this transition?"

**MARCUS:** "A few guys from my unit, but I haven't really talked to them about work."

**HANK:** "What stops you from reaching out?"

**MARCUS:** "I guess... pride? Don't want to seem like I'm struggling."

**HANK:** "What if they felt the same way during their transition? What would you have wanted them to do?"

**MARCUS:** "I'd want them to call me. I'd help in a heartbeat."

**HANK:** "There's your answer. Ready to flip your approach?"

---

## **SCENE 2: TWO-ROUND STRATEGY (90 seconds)**

**HANK:** "Most job seekers make one mistake \- they network with an agenda. Here's what actually works: two distinct rounds of conversations. First round \- pure learning. What questions would you want to ask another veteran who successfully transitioned to operations?"

**MARCUS:** "How they explained their military experience? What surprised them about corporate culture? Which companies actually value military experience?"

**HANK:** "Perfect. Those are exploration questions \- no agenda, just curiosity. You have 3-5 coffee chats like that. Then round two \- that's when you leverage what you learned. How would you approach someone differently the second time?"

**MARCUS:** "I'd know what they actually care about. I could be more specific about what I'm looking for."

**HANK:** "Exactly. And here's the key \- in round two, you make what I call a Goldilocks ask. Not 'Can you get me a job?' \- too big. Not 'Can I send my resume?' \- too small. What would be just right?"

**MARCUS:** "Maybe... asking for an introduction to someone specific?"

**HANK:** "Now you're thinking strategically. 'Would you introduce me to Sarah in operations?' \- specific, actionable, easy to say yes to."

---

## **SCENE 3: SKILLS TRANSLATION WORK (60 seconds)**

**HANK:** "Let's make your experience speak their language. When you say you led 25 people, what were you actually doing day-to-day?"

**MARCUS:** "Planning operations, managing resources, dealing with unexpected problems, making sure everything ran smooth under pressure."

**HANK:** "In civilian terms, you just described crisis management, resource optimization, and operational excellence. Your $2M equipment responsibility \- in corporate terms, that's what?"

**MARCUS:** "P\&L management? Budget responsibility?"

**HANK:** "Exactly. You're not learning new concepts \- you're learning new vocabulary. What other military experience might civilians not understand?"

**MARCUS:** "Deployment logistics \- coordinating supplies across multiple time zones, dealing with vendors, managing complex supply chains."

**HANK:** "That's global supply chain management. See the pattern?"

---

## **SCENE 4: FINDING CONNECTIONS (90 seconds)**

**HANK:** "Who could you reach out to this week for those learning conversations?"

**MARCUS:** "There's Tom from my unit \- he's at Amazon now. And maybe some guys from the veteran groups I'm in."

**HANK:** "Tom at Amazon is perfect. What would you say to him that feels natural, not forced?"

**MARCUS:** "Maybe... 'Hey Tom, saw you're killing it at Amazon. I'm starting my transition. Would love to hear what surprised you about the shift to civilian work. Coffee's on me?'"

**HANK:** "That's authentic. No agenda, just connection. What about people you don't know well \- weak ties? Research shows they're 6x more likely to lead to opportunities."

**MARCUS:** "My degree program had alumni... never really connected with them."

**HANK:** "Why not?"

**MARCUS:** "Felt weird reaching out cold."

**HANK:** "What would make it feel less weird?"

**MARCUS:** "If I had something in common besides just the school... Maybe if they were also veterans?"

**HANK:** "LinkedIn lets you search alumni who are veterans. 'Fellow veteran and State U alum' \- that's not cold, that's warm. How many could you reach out to this week?"

**MARCUS:** "Realistically? Maybe 5?"

**HANK:** "Five conversations could change everything. Ready to draft that first message?"
